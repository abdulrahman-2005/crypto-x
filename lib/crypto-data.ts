    shortDescription: "The first and most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries.",
    fullContent: "Bitcoin (BTC) is the first decentralized cryptocurrency, created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on a peer-to-peer network without the need for intermediaries like banks. Bitcoin's key features include its limited supply (21 million coins), decentralized nature, and security through blockchain technology. The cryptocurrency has gained significant adoption as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. Its Islamic status is generally considered Halal due to its decentralized nature and lack of interest-based transactions.",

While the technology itself is neutral, its use in gambling, speculation, and other non-compliant activities raises concerns. However, its utility in legitimate business applications and the transition to PoS have made it more acceptable to some Islamic scholars."
